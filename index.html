        <p>
          The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch
          in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the
          German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der
          Natur (The Scream of Nature).

          Love and Pain is an 1895 painting by Edvard Munch; it has also been
          called Vampire, though not by Munch.[1] The painting depicts a man and
          woman embracing, with the woman kissing the man on his neck. Munch
          painted six different versions of the same subject between 1893 and
          1895.

          The Sick Child (Norwegian: Det syke barn) is the title given to a
          group of six paintings and a number of lithographs, drypoints and
          etchings completed by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch between 1885
          and 1926. All record a moment before the death of his older sister
          Johanne Sophie (1862–1877) from tuberculosis at 15.

        <h1>evening on karl johan street.</h1>
        <p>
          Edvard Munch’s “Evening on Karl Johan Street” is a painting from his
          Frieze series, which he produced in the 1890s. The painting depicts a
          crowd of black-coated figures with corpse-white faces walking through
          the main street in Kristiana (now Oslo). This scene is a manifestation
          of one of Munch’s anxiety dreams, transformed into an artwork that
          conveys unease and threat through its cropping techniques.

        <p>
          A young woman, identified by the title as Munch's youngest sister
          Inger, sits in a quiet pose, a straw hat in her hands, on a large
          granite rock and holds her head in profile. Her bright white dress
          contrasts with the green mossy stones and the blues and purples of the
          sea water behind her, which, as the alternative titles indicate,
          suggests Nordic summer nights. Only a few pots and a fishing boat
          behind her betray human life in the countryside. Munch used a similar
          pose for his 1884 interior composition Morning, featuring a girl on
          the edge of a bed.

        <h1><span>painter : </span>Edvard Munch</h1>
        <p>
          Edvard Munch (12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian
          painter. His 1893 work, The Scream, has become one of Western art's
          most acclaimed images. His childhood was overshadowed by illness,
          bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in
          the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in
          Kristiania (today's Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life under
          the influence of the nihilist Hans Jæger, who urged him to paint his
          own emotional and psychological state ('soul painting'); from this
          emerged his distinctive style.
